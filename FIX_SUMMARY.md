# Fix Summary: AM/PM Period Persistence Issue

## Problem Description

When setting shift timings in the admin settings page (`/public/admin/settings.php`), the AM/PM indicators would not persist correctly after saving and reloading the page. Specifically:

- User sets evening times with PM (e.g., "3:00 PM")
- After saving and refreshing, times would revert to AM (e.g., "3:00 AM")
- The database WAS correctly storing both the 24-hour time AND the separate AM/PM period settings
- The issue was in the JavaScript loading logic

## Root Cause

The problem was a race condition and priority issue in `settings.js`:

1. **Database stores two fields per time**:
   - Time in 24-hour format: `evening_checkin_start = "21:00:00"`
   - Period separately: `evening_checkin_start_period = "PM"`

2. **Original loading logic flaw**:
   ```javascript
   // PROBLEM: Period dropdowns were set first
   // But then convertAndSetTime() would RECALCULATE the period from 24-hour time
   // This would overwrite the saved PM with a calculated value
   ```

3. **The calculation logic issue**:
   - When `convertAndSetTime()` saw `21:00:00`, it would calculate: "21 >= 12 → PM" ✓ Correct
   - But when it saw `04:00:00`, it would calculate: "4 < 12 → AM" ✓ Correct for 4 AM
   - **BUT** if user intentionally set "4:00 PM" (16:00 in 24-hour), the system would convert 16 → 4, then recalculate as AM

4. **The actual issue**: The period field VALUE was being set in the first pass, but then the `convertAndSetTime` function was not properly USING that pre-set value. It was preferring the calculated value over the saved value.

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified: `public/admin/assets/js/settings.js`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Two-pass loading with explicit period map** (lines 109-180):
   ```javascript
   // First pass: Collect ALL period settings into a map BEFORE processing times
   const periodSettings = {};
   
   // Load all *_period fields first
   if (setting.key.includes('_period')) {
       periodSettings[setting.key] = setting.value;
       element.value = setting.value;
   }
   
   // Second pass: Load time fields, passing the periodSettings map
   convertAndSetTime(setting.key, setting.value, periodSettings);
   ```

2. **Priority-based period selection** (lines 186-257):
   ```javascript
   function convertAndSetTime(fieldId, time24, periodSettings) {
       // Priority 1: Use saved period from database (NEW!)
       if (periodSettings && periodSettings[fieldId + '_period']) {
           period = periodSettings[fieldId + '_period'];
       }
       // Priority 2: Check DOM value (fallback)
       else if (periodSelect && periodSelect.value) {
           period = periodSelect.value;
       }
       // Priority 3: Calculate from 24-hour time (last resort)
       else {
           period = hours24 >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM';
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Better logging**:
   - Added detailed console logs showing which priority path was used
   - Shows both 12-hour and 24-hour representations for debugging

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open the admin settings page**:
   ```
   http://localhost/qr/public/admin/settings.php
   ```

2. **Set evening shift times with PM**:
   - Evening Check-in Start: `3:00 PM`
   - Evening Check-in End: `6:00 PM`
   - Evening Class End: `7:00 PM`

3. **Save settings** (click "Save All" button)

4. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)

5. **Verify**:
   - All evening times should still show PM
   - Morning times should show AM
   - Check browser console (F12) for log messages confirming "Using saved period from database"

6. **Database verification** (optional):
   ```powershell
   C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root -e "USE qr_attendance; SELECT setting_key, setting_value FROM system_settings WHERE setting_key LIKE '%evening%' AND (setting_key LIKE '%checkin%' OR setting_key LIKE '%class_end%');"
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ AM/PM periods persist correctly across page reloads
- ✅ Database stores both 24-hour time AND period separately
- ✅ Loading logic uses saved period value as Priority 1
- ✅ No more automatic conversion overwriting user's choice
- ✅ Console logs clearly show which period source is used

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Each time field has TWO corresponding records:
-- 1. The time in 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS)
INSERT INTO system_settings (setting_key, setting_value, setting_type) 
VALUES ('evening_checkin_start', '21:00:00', 'time');

-- 2. The AM/PM period indicator (separate field)
INSERT INTO system_settings (setting_key, setting_value, setting_type) 
VALUES ('evening_checkin_start_period', 'PM', 'string');
```

### How It Works Now

1. **User enters**: `3:00 PM`
2. **JavaScript collects**: `time = "3:00"`, `period = "PM"`
3. **JavaScript saves**: `convert12to24("3:00 PM")` → `"15:00:00"` + separate `period = "PM"`
4. **Database stores**: TWO records (time as "15:00:00", period as "PM")
5. **On reload**: Load period FIRST → period = "PM" from DB
6. **Then convert time**: "15:00:00" → display as "3:00" with SAVED period "PM" ✓

## Files Changed

1. `public/admin/assets/js/settings.js`
   - Modified `populateSettingsForm()` function (lines 109-180)
   - Modified `convertAndSetTime()` function (lines 186-257)

## No Backend Changes Required

The backend API (`public/admin/api/settings.php`) was already correctly:
- ✅ Saving both time and period fields
- ✅ Retrieving both fields from database
- ✅ Returning them in the API response

The issue was purely in the frontend JavaScript loading logic.

## Backward Compatibility

This fix is fully backward compatible:
- Existing time records in database work correctly
- The `periodSettings` parameter is optional (falls back to calculation)
- No database migrations needed
- No API changes required
